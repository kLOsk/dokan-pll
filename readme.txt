Polylang integration for Dokan Multivendor Plugin

== Description ==
Dokan Multivendor is based on the famous eCommerce solution WooCommerce. Polylang allows the user to translate their WordPress site into a multilanguage CMS.
These extensions are required to make your Dokan store multilanguage

1. Polylang Pro
2. Polylang for WooCommerce

After purchasing all these extensions and installing them, you need to install this extension. It will not work unless you have activated all the plugins mentioned above.

Make sure to resave your permalinks. If you get 404 errors when accessing the product edit screen in Dokan save your permalinks twice!

Please remember to set the URL structure to `site.com/lang`.

Dokan does not support URL parameters. So you can NOT set the URL structure to be `site.com?lang=nl`

This plugin supports the GitHub Updater: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater

== Installation ==
1. Install and activate Polylang Pro and Polylang for WooCommerce.
2. Configure Polylang Pro and Polylang for WooCommerce.
3. Install and activate Dokan - Polylang Integration plugin.
4. Navigate to – WP Dashboard → Languages → Settings → URL modifications. Set the translation link structure to directory name and remove the /language/ part. That means the translation link for french would be `site.com/fr`.
5. Create translation of your pages and products and you are done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Does this work with the free version of Polylang?
Ans: Possibly. I don't see why not, but haven't tested it yet.

2. Will this plugin translate everything automatically?
Ans: No. All these plugins enables the system to work across all the languages you want to use. You have to create each post and page manually and translate each sentence and word manually.

3. Is there an easy way to translate all my content?
Ans: Yes, Polylang integrates with Lingotek. Read about it on the Polylang website (https://polylang.pro)
